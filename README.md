## 🔍 What is Belief Ecology?

**Belief Ecology™** is a novel internal cognition architecture for artificial intelligence.  
Unlike static knowledge graphs or vector memories, beliefs here are **living cognitive entities** — they decay, mutate, contradict, reinforce, and compete for relevance.

Each belief is:

- Weighted
- Time-sensitive
- Contradiction-aware
- Evolving based on system tension and goals

This allows for introspective AI systems that can adapt identity, resolve internal conflict, and operate with self-regulating memory loops.

## 🧩 Key Modules (As Implemented in Blackbox Mind™ v3)

### 1. Input Parser  
Transforms language/events into structured cognitive units (belief objects).  
Example: `"I am scared"` → `{subject: "self", value: "fear", weight: 0.9}`

### 2. Belief Stack  
Stores beliefs with time decay, relevance weighting, contradiction logs, mutation frequency.

### 3. Contradiction Handler  
Detects logical or semantic conflicts between beliefs.  
Assigns `tension` scores.

### 4. Cognitive Loop Controller  
Triggers recursive internal reasoning based on system tension.  
Simulates introspection and reappraisal.

### 5. Output Composer  
Generates text based on active beliefs and current tension state.
