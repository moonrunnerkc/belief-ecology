## üîç Overview

**Belief Ecology** is an original AI architecture designed to emulate cognitive self-regulation through belief modeling, contradiction tracing, memory decay, and dynamic mutation. It simulates core features of autonomous thought ‚Äî memory lifecycle, internal contradiction management, and recursive goal-aligned adaptation.

This repository contains a protected core of my **original Belief Ecology framework**, created and engineered solely by me. It is part of a larger suite of agentic cognition modules developed under my intellectual property portfolio.

## üß¨ Technical Summary

- Recursive Contradiction Tracing System (RCTS)
- Belief mutation via semantic fusion and fitness decay
- Persistent episodic memory and entropy decay
- Fully offline-compatible and memory-efficient
- Designed for agentic reasoning and evolving logic networks

This is a novel architecture. No prior public implementation of this exact system exists. All underlying logic and modular designs are fully original.

## üîç What is Belief Ecology?

**Belief Ecology‚Ñ¢** is a novel internal cognition architecture for artificial intelligence.  
Unlike static knowledge graphs or vector memories, beliefs here are **living cognitive entities** ‚Äî they decay, mutate, contradict, reinforce, and compete for relevance.

Each belief is:

- Weighted
- Time-sensitive
- Contradiction-aware
- Evolving based on system tension and goals

This allows for introspective AI systems that can adapt identity, resolve internal conflict, and operate with self-regulating memory loops.

## üß© Key Modules (As Implemented in Blackbox Mind‚Ñ¢ v3)

### 1. Input Parser  
Transforms language/events into structured cognitive units (belief objects).  
Example: `"I am scared"` ‚Üí `{subject: "self", value: "fear", weight: 0.9}`

### 2. Belief Stack  
Stores beliefs with time decay, relevance weighting, contradiction logs, mutation frequency.

### 3. Contradiction Handler  
Detects logical or semantic conflicts between beliefs.  
Assigns `tension` scores.

### 4. Cognitive Loop Controller  
Triggers recursive internal reasoning based on system tension.  
Simulates introspection and reappraisal.

### 5. Output Composer  
Generates text based on active beliefs and current tension state.
